# writing_underlays

```
bundle exec ruby papers.rb
```

will build a guides.pdf file and try to open it with preview. The pdf has a number of pages, each of which
is intended to be cut out and used as a guide for writing in a paperforfountainpens.com [blank book](http://paperforfountainpens.com/collections/all/products/blank-book-cream)

White with dark lines is good for writing on 1 side of the page, black with white lines hides show-through if you're
using both sides of the page. papers.rb has page sizes/margins/line weights defined - change it to suite your
notebook and personal tastes.
